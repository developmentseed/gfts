# Tagging survey description

To better understand the sea bass ecology and the spatio-temporal structure of the population, ten tagging surveys were carried out along the French coasts during the summers of 2014, 2015, and 2016 (Table 1, Figure 1). Tagging followed the protocol developed during a pilot study in the Iroise Sea (de Pontual et al., 2019). The national fishery committee (CNPMEM) charted two to three professional fishing vessels per survey. One or two vessels were in charge of fishing (rod and lines), while another was used as a support vessel, moored in sheltered waters, where fish were transferred to, tagged, and released on the same day they were caught. Carefully selected fish (>41.5 cm total length (TL), tag to body mass ratio <2%, apparently good condition) were tagged following the protocol of de Pontual et al. (2019). Fish were tattooed by intradermal injection with alcian blue. Ethics rules were strictly observed and tagging was carried out under a project licence n° 01987.02 authorized by the French Ministry of Agriculture and Environment.

The DST type was Cefas G5 long life 2 Mb, with temperature and pressure sensors and a battery life of 2 years. Tags were calibrated with a pressure range of 0--2000 kPa, allowing a maximum depth record of ∼230 m. Pressure and temperature were recorded at 90s intervals for the first 680 days and at 3min for the 50 remaining days. Logging regimes were the same for all surveys. In order to increase the recovery rate of DSTs, we used floating tags that could drift ashore in case fish died at sea, regardless of the cause of death.

Experiments were advertised through various media, posters and mailings to fishers and stakeholders all along the French coasts (Figure 2). Posters in English and Spanish were sent to research institutes in the United Kingdom, Belgium, Netherlands and Spain to promote the return of tagged fish recaptured abroad. A reward of 100€ was offered for each tagged fish returned to the laboratory (50€ for a DST alone) and a further 1000€ awarded in a prize draw among all participants.

Out of 1220 deployed DSTs, 482 have been recovered by November 2022. Approximately half of them included a period of potential spawning migration. Reconstructed trajectories reconstructed using a geolocation model (Woillez et al., 2016) confirmed sea bass to be a partial migratory species, as individuals exhibited either long distance migrations or residence. Most migrants exhibited fidelity to summer feeding areas and to winter spawning areas. Our results suggest a spatial structure of the Atlantic population that differ from the stock structure currently considered for assessment and management (de Pontual et al., 2023). The consequences should be explored at both the European level and by regional managers involved in conservation outcomes.

## Seasonal distribution

In the North-East Atlantic, largest abundances are reported around the British Isles and in the Bay of Biscay. Seasonal migration of adult sea bass occurred between inshore summer feeding grounds and offshore overwintering spawning grounds. Spawning migrations initiate between October and December, and corresponding return migrations occurring from March to May. Starting in winter off the Iberian Peninsula and in the Bay of Biscay, spawning progresses to the North / North-East until late spring. With increasing temperatures in the North Sea, delayed winter migration could take place over shorter distances. This could favour a northward expansion and a year-round residence of sea bass in the North Sea and Norwegian coastal waters.

**Quarter 1:** Winter is the spawning period for adult sea bass. They aggregate offshore over spawning grounds.

**Quarter 2:** Most of adult sea bass migrate from offshore spawning grounds to inshore feeding grounds. Some adult sea bass may still be found on offshore spawning grounds especially in the English Channel and the southern North Sea.

**Quarter 3:** Adult sea bass are located inshore over summer feeding grounds.

**Quarter 4:** Most of adult sea bass migrate from inshore summer feeding grounds to offshore spawning grounds. Some adult sea bass may already be found on offshore spawning grounds, making pre-spawning aggregations.
