# Tagging survey description

Tagging experiments were undertaken for pollack to analyse its spatial population dynamics in the English Channel, where declining stocks are raising concern.

The tagging procedure involved a fishing vessel and a support vessel for surgery and stalling. On the fishing vessel, professional rod and line fishers utilized their ecological knowledge to catch pollack at locations with depths not exceeding 15 m, aiming to maximize survival and minimize barotrauma, for which the species is very sensitive to. Then, the tagging followed the protocol developed for sea bass (de Pontual et al., 2019). In 2022, a total of 70 pollack were tagged in the French waters (Table 1). The maximum total length of selected fish was 62 cm and the mean total length was 47 cm. Ethical guidelines were strictly observed and all tagging procedures were conducted under the project license APAFIS#32389--201070816107734v5, which was authorized by the French Ministry of Higher Education, Research and Innovation.

The present reconstructions illustrate pollack movements across the English Channel by coupling archival tagging and acoustic telemetry (Figure 1). This study aimed to (1) assess the feasibility of double-tagging for pollack and (2) track seasonal movements of pollack by analysing the timing of acoustic detections and by running a geolocation model fed with both archival and acoustic telemetry data.

| Pilot sites | Fish equipped with acoustic tags (+ DST) | Mean and range of fish total length (mm) | Acoustic stations deployed | Acoustic stations serviced |
|-------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| Iroise | 55 (37) | 508 [386--622] | 29 | 23 |
| Armor | 14 (11) | 486 [408--560] | 33 | 27 |
| Seine | 1 (0) | 430 | 18 | 14 |

## Seasonal distribution

Pollack is a bentho-demersal species from the Gadidae family distributed in the North East Atlantic from Portugal to Norway. Juveniles are coastal during their first 2 years, while adults are found offshore at depths between 40 and 100 m. Reproduction occurs between February and May from the Iberian coast to the Celtic Sea and extends up to June along the Norwegian coast. Mature individuals (Length at 50% maturity = 43.71 cm) aggregate during this period.

**Quarter 1:** Winter is the spawning period, during which mature pollacks aggregate.

**Quarter 2:** Spring is the spawning period, during which mature pollacks aggregate.

**Quarter 3:** Feeding period.

**Quarter 4:** Feeding period.
